    "House Atreides mines spice at a set of locations $M$ on Arrakis and ships it to a set of Houses $H$.  The cost per ton of producing spice at mine $m \\in M$ is $p_m$.  The sand content (in percent) of the spice at mine $m \\in M$ is $a_m$, the sulfur content of the spice at mine $m \\in M$ is $s_m$, and the total tons of spice available at mine $m \\in M$ is $u_m$.  Each House $h \\in H$ requires $d_h$ tons of spice.  The cost (in Solari) of shipping a ton of spice from mine $m \\in M$ to House $h \\in H$ is $c_{mh}$.

In order to refine the spice, House Atreides must operate its many refineries, which require water. In order to increase the output of spice at a refinery, there is a \"cost\" of 120 gallons of water per ton to operate the refinery at the higher output level. If instead the refinery  decreases production level of spice by 1 ton/day, the cost per ton is only 50 gallons of water. (E.g., if current production level is 10 tons and the refinery wants to increase output to 12 tons, the cost is 2 tons * 120 gallons/ton = 240 gallons.) \n",

To operate a larger storage unit, additional tons (above 80) can be stored at a cost of 50 gallons of water per ton of spice. (Inventory is checked at the end of each day.) If the refinery is unable to meet demand for a given day, House Atreides will be penalized by the Empire and must pay 100 gallons of water per ton of spice short. \n",

    "You recently discovered you can make some extra money by leasing polyhedral dice to a group of friends playing Dungeons and Dragons. You recently lent 85 dice to 10 different people. Unforuntately, you made some mistakes and gave some people the wrong number of dice. The players have agreed to help with redistributing the dice, as long as they don't have to drive very far.  Suppose that the time to drive between each pair of people is 1.5 times the Euclidean distance to travel between each location given in the table below. The cost of gas is \\\\$0.40 per minute of driving. Although it is a bad strategy, also assume that the cost of traveling is per die (so transporting 2 dice a given distance costs 2$\\times$1.5$\\times$0.4$\\times$distance).\n",
