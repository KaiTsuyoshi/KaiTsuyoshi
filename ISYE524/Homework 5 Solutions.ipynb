    "Fizzy Water, Inc. is designing a pipe that disinfects their water before it is packaged. The pipe is designed to heat the water to $T$ (degrees above ambient temperature). The pipe has a fixed length and circular cross section with radius $r$.  The pipe is wrapped in a layer of material with thickenss $w$ (much smaller than $r$) for insulation to minimize heat loss. The design variables for the pipe are $T, r,$ and $w$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Heat loss can be converted to energy cost and is roughly equal to $(\\alpha_1Tr)/w$ for some constant $\\alpha_1$. The cost of the pipe is approximately proportional to the total material used: $\\alpha_2r$ for a constant $\\alpha_2$. The insulation cost, similarly,is porportional to the total insulation material used, or roughly $\\alpha_3rw$ for a constant $\\alpha_3$. The total cost of constructing and using the pipe is the sum of these three costs. \n",

    "Fizzy Water wants to maximize the total heat flow through the pipe, which is proportional to the velocity of the water through the pipe. This value can be approximated by $\\alpha_4Tr^2$ for a constant $\\alpha_4$. All $\\alpha$ constants and all variables $T, r, w$ are strictly positive. \n",

Assume for simplicity that every variable ($T,r,w$) has a lower bound of 1 and no upper bound. Solve this problem using JuMP. Use the Ipopt solver (or any other solver that can solve convex optimization problems) and the \"@NLconstraint(...)\" command to specify any nonlinear constraints. What are the optimal $T, r$, and $w$?\n"
