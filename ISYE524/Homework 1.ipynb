    "* Which solver is most accurate (gets closest to the \"right\" answer)?  \n",
    "* Which is fastest (use the @time macro)? NOTE: you should notice it takes longer to solve the problem the first time you run your code, and goes much faster if you re-sovle subsequent times. The first time you run the code, the solver takes extra time to compile/\"load\" the model (it doesn't repeat the compilation step in future re-solves).\n",
    "    * Can you speculate as to why? \n",
    "* If there is no clear difference between the solvers, can you think of some factors that might contribute to solver speed differences? \n",

    "bushels of hay and requires 10 hours of labor per week. An acre of corn yields 10 bushels of corn and requires 4 hours of labor per week. All hay can be sold at \\$4 a bushel, and all corn can be sold at \\$3 a bushel. Seven acres of land and 40 hours per week of labor are available. Government regulations require that at least 30 bushels of corn be produced during the current year. \n",
    "\n",
    "(a)  Formulate a linear program to help Famer Brandt plan his crops for the upcoming season to maximize his revenue. State the math model, then code and solve the model using Julia. (Hint: you should have two decision variables).\n",

    "(b)  Code the same model once again, this time separating the parameters from the solution as we did in class (see Top Brass examples).  Confirm that you obtain the same solution as in part (a).  \n",

    "(c)  Solve  the  problem  graphically  by  plotting  the  feasible  set  and  at least two isocost lines for the objective function.  Confirm that you obtain the same solution as in the previous parts.\n",

    "## Problem 3 - OptiMine\n",
    "\n",
    "A mining company (\"OptiMine\") is planning mine operations for the next week. There are 10 different mine locations available for ore extraction. OptiMine needs to mine 3,000 tons of ore to meet demand. Each mine location has a total number of tons of ore available. Mining at each location has an associated cost per ton. Finally, ore extracted from each mine contains a different percentage of different elements (e.g., carbon, gold). The cost, ore available, and percentage of elements in the ore at each mining location are given in the .csv file \"mine.csv.\" A sample of the data is given in the table below. There is a minimum percentage of each element required across the total ore extracted, also given in the .csv file. \n",

    "(a) Formulate a linear program to help OptiMine plan mining operations to meet requriments at a minimal cost. Give a general form (parameters only -- no numbers) of the math model.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Implement and solve this instance of the model in Julia/JuMP.  Display the optimal objective value and the optimal variable values.\n"
