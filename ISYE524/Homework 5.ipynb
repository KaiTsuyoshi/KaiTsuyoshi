    "Fizzy Water, Inc. is designing a pipe that disinfects their water before it is packaged. The pipe is designed to heat the water to $T$ (degrees above ambient temperature). The pipe has a fixed length and circular cross section with radius $r$.  The pipe is wrapped in a layer of material with thickenss $w$ (much smaller than $r$) for insulation to minimize heat loss. The design variables for the pipe are $T, r,$ and $w$. \n",

The cost of the pipe is approximately proportional to the total material used: $\\alpha_2r$ for a constant $\\alpha_2$. The insulation cost, similarly,is porportional to the total insulation material used, or roughly $\\alpha_3rw$ for a constant $\\alpha_3$. The total cost of constructing and using the pipe is the sum of these three costs. \n",
