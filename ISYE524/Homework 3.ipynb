    "## Problem 1 - Max Flow Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "A Dungeon Master (DM) is trying to plan for the next three campaigns she is running. She runs campaigns for four different groups, and she is hoping to finish the groups' campaigns in the next six months.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Group 1's campaign must be completed no later than 4 months from now and will require 20 total hours of play-time \n",
    "* Group 2's campaign must be completed no later than 5 months from now and will require 18 total hours of play-time \n",
    "*  Group 3's campaign must be completed no later than 6 months from now and will require 13 total hours of play-time \n",

    "Formulate a _maximum flow problem_ whose solution will determine whether or not all four campaigns can be completed on time.  Your answer should clearly draw the network, the source node, the sink node, and capacity on each arc in the network.  Upload a picture of the network with your solution.\n",
